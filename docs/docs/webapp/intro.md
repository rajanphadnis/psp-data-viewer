# Intro

Inspired by a weird combination of Borg and Telemetron.

Access the Webapp here: [https://psp.rajanphadnis.com](https://psp.rajanphadnis.com) 

And the Admin console here: [https://psp-admin.rajanphadnis.com](https://psp-admin.rajanphadnis.com)


data is shown in your local timezone, but stored in the database in UTC time


## Roadmap:

Progress is made whenever I'm bored, but here are the features I'll eventually implement:

- Easy access to full data export
- Popup to provide code samples to access data that is currently visible
- Guided tour
- Annotations (they're already in the API)
- Better UX in modals
- JSON settings & calc channels import/export
- Need to comment the code :/
