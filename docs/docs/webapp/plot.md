# Plots

Plotting data is optimized for plotting speed rather than customization - although a lot of customization is possible!

## Plotting Data

Select a dataset on the right hand side to add it to the plot. If the dataset over that time period is cached, it'll appear on the plot almost immediately. If not, the green check mark in the top right corner will turn into a gold loading circle - which indicates that the website just made a call to the API and is waiting for a response from the server.

Once the data is plotted, the legend on the bottom shows the value of the data as you hover over it. You can hide a dataset by clicking on it in the legend. If you want to stop plotting the dataset altogether, click the dataset name in the panel on the right.

## Zooming

To zoom in, simply drag over the area you want to zoom into

To zoom all the way out, double click anywhere on the plot.

Selectively zooming out is not possible at this point. This is a feature under consideration, but would be a large undertaking. A `+`/`-` button is under consideration instead

## Panning

:::info

Panning is not possible at this point. This is a feature under consideration, but would be a large undertaking. As a temporary workaround, zoom out by double clicking, then re-zooming to the desired plotted area
