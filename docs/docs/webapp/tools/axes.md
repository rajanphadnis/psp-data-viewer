# Axes

You can customize and control the side of the plot your datasets show their axes on by clicking the number that appears in the dark yellow button next to the dataset name in the list of available datasets. 

There are six axes sets that can be toggled between on a per-dataset basis.

All `psi` datasets on the same axis are grouped together. Same goes for all other units.
