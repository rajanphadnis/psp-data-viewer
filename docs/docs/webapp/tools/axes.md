# Axes

You can customize and control the side of the plot your datasets show their axes on by clicking the number that appears in the dark yellow button next to the dataset name in the list of available datasets. 

Note that all binary data shares the same vertical axis, so to change binary data's axes side, you'll have to change it via the first binary dataset you selected.
